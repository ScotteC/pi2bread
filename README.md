## pi2bread

Just a simple connector board to distribute a Raspberry Pis GPIO port to your breadboard.

Another one? Why? Why not unsing an existing one???
Because i don't like the existing ones.
Most of the avaliable connectors distribute the pins as exact copy of the original GPIO header, including the supply pins.
This version separates signal and supply pins, add jumpers to cut the supplys and rearranges the pinuout, based on some personal needs.
